# This is the same dependency and repository as `3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev` below.
#
# When forking `inference-engine` into to this project, I made an earnest attempt to utilize the preexisting
# `3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev` submodule within `inference-engine`. Unfortunately, I ran into several roadblocks:
#
#   1) I cannot directly add `3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev` as a cmake subdirectory because cmake is aware that
#      this path is not a subdirectory of the `inference-engine` project root.
#
#   2) Symbolic links do not appear to work for git submodule direcotires the way that they do for regular directories.
#      Even if the symbolic link had linked correctly, it may have still failed due to the considerations of 1).
#
#   3) I tried using cmake to copy the files from `3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev` into `inference-engine/3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev`
#      at build time, which would ensure that there is no duplicate reference to the URL in this file, however the upstream dependency itself
#      has hard-coded cmake expectations that the `.git` directory is only one level up, which appears to work correctly for the way git submodules
#      are configured, but does not work if the files are copied over to a regular directory deeper in the repository.
#
# It may be possible to remove `3rd_party/browsermt-marian-dev` to instead use `inference-engine/3rd-party/browsermt-marian-dev` everywhere
# within this repository, but I will leave that for a future commit if there is a need to do so.
